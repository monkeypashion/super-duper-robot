    <h1>Germany <strong class="date">1890–1945</strong>: Democracy and Dictatorship</h1>

    <h2 id="kaiser">Kaiserreich & Prelude to Democracy</h2>
<p>
  Under <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Wilhelm II ruled from 1888 to 1918 with near-absolute power. His personal decisions often destabilised both domestic and foreign policy.">Kaiser Wilhelm</span>, Germany was an authoritarian empire. While there was a <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Reichstag existed but had limited power. The Kaiser could overrule it and appoint/dismiss the Chancellor.">parliamentary government</span>, real power lay with the Kaiser. The state was shaped by <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Prussia had long dominated German politics. Its military values of obedience and nationalism were central to German identity.">Prussian militarism</span> and driven by rapid <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany industrialised quickly, especially in coal, steel and chemicals. This caused urbanisation and tensions with old elites.">industrialisation</span>. Social tensions grew, leading to attempts at <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Legislation introduced to improve worker conditions aimed to reduce support for the socialist movement.">social reform</span> and rising support for <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The SPD became the largest party by 1912, advocating for workers' rights and democracy.">socialism</span>. Ambitious <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Laws passed to build a large navy to rival Britain, reflecting Germany's desire for global status.">Navy Laws</span> reflected Germany's desire to rival Britain as a naval power.
</p>

<h2 id="ww1">First World War & Aftermath</h2>
<p>
  The First World War left Germany in ruins. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany lost over 2 million soldiers. Civilians faced hunger due to the British blockade.">impact of the war</span> included <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="By 1917-18, civilian morale collapsed. Protests and mutinies spread across Germany.">war weariness</span>, severe <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany was bankrupt. The cost of war and reparations created lasting instability.">economic problems</span>, and a sense of <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany was forced to accept full blame for the war in the Treaty of Versailles.">defeat</span> which led to the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Wilhelm II abdicated in November 1918, ending 500 years of monarchy.">end of the monarchy</span>. The harsh <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Treaty of Versailles demanded £6.6 billion in reparations, seen by many Germans as unjust.">reparations</span> imposed by the Treaty of Versailles and the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 after Germany missed payments. Workers went on strike; the government printed money to support them.">occupation of the Ruhr</span> only worsened the crisis. The resulting <span id="hyperinflation" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Prices spiralled so badly in 1923 that savings became worthless. Some Germans bartered instead of using money.">hyperinflation</span> destroyed public trust in the economy.
</p>

<h2 id="weimar">Weimar Republic: Unrest and Recovery</h2>
<p>
  The new <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany became a democratic republic in 1919, named after the town of Weimar where the constitution was written.">Weimar Republic</span> was born in crisis. Early years saw violent <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Groups on both the left and right violently opposed the new republic, challenging its authority.">political unrest</span>, with threats from the left like the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Communist uprising in Berlin, January 1919, crushed by the army and Freikorps.">Spartacists</span> and from the right with the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="March 1920: a failed right-wing coup involving ex-soldiers and civil servants.">Kapp Putsch</span>. Even Hitler attempted a coup in the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Hitler's 1923 failed attempt to seize power in Munich; he was imprisoned and wrote Mein Kampf.">Munich Putsch</span>. However, from <strong class="date">1924–1929</strong>, the Republic stabilised under <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A moderate politician who helped stabilise Germany's economy and improve foreign relations.">Stresemann</span>.
</p>
<p id="stresemann">
  Key measures included a new <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Rentenmark replaced the worthless mark in 1923, restoring confidence in the economy.">currency</span>, economic plans like the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="1924: US loans helped Germany pay reparations and rebuild industry.">Dawes Plan</span> and later the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="1929: reduced total reparations, but came just before the Wall Street Crash.">Young Plan</span>. Internationally, Germany signed agreements that improved its status, such as the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="1925: Germany, France, and Belgium agreed to respect post-war borders.">Locarno Pact</span> and joined the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany was admitted to the League of Nations in 1926, signalling its diplomatic rehabilitation.">League of Nations</span>. Culturally, this was a time of experimentation and liberalism, known as <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Art, cinema, architecture and nightlife flourished, but were seen by conservatives as decadent.">Weimar culture</span>.
</p>

<h2 id="depression">Germany and the Depression</h2>
<p>
  The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="After the 1929 Wall Street Crash, US loans stopped. German businesses collapsed and unemployment soared.">Great Depression</span> had devastating effects on Germany. Support grew rapidly for <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Voters turned to parties promising radical change — especially the Nazis and Communists.">extremist parties</span> between <strong class="date">1928</strong> and <strong class="date">1932</strong>, with the Nazis using the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party that intimidated opponents and stirred up unrest.">SA</span> to project strength and fear. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="He promised to restore pride, rebuild the economy and punish those blamed for Germany's problems.">Hitler's appeal</span> helped fuel their rise.
</p>
<p>
  As the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Democracy appeared weak and indecisive; governments were short-lived and ineffective.">Weimar system failed</span> to deliver solutions, key figures like <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Conservative politician who tried to control Hitler by making him part of government.">Papen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="President of Germany who reluctantly appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933.">Hindenburg</span> enabled Hitler’s rise, culminating in his appointment as Chancellor in <strong class="date">1933</strong>.
</p>

<h2 id="dictatorship">Establishment of Hitler’s Dictatorship</h2>
<p>
  After Hitler’s appointment as Chancellor in <strong class="date">1933</strong>, the Nazis moved quickly to secure power. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="27 February 1933: the Reichstag building was set on fire. Nazis blamed communists, using it to justify emergency powers.">Reichstag Fire</span> allowed Hitler to suppress opposition and pass the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Passed in March 1933, this law let Hitler pass laws without Reichstag approval, creating a legal dictatorship.">Enabling Act</span>, giving him legislative power. Political <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Other political parties were banned or intimidated into dissolving themselves by July 1933.">opposition</span> was removed and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Independent trade unions were banned and replaced with the German Labour Front.">trade unions</span> were abolished.
</p>
<p>
  In <strong class="date">1934</strong>, Hitler targeted internal threats with the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="30 June 1934: Hitler had Röhm and other SA leaders executed to appease the army and consolidate power.">Night of the Long Knives</span>, eliminating the SA leadership and rivals. When President Hindenburg died, Hitler declared himself <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="From August 1934, Hitler combined the roles of Chancellor and President, taking full control as Führer.">Führer</span> of Germany, completing the creation of his dictatorship.
</p>
  <h2 id="nazi-experiences">The Experiences of Germans under the Nazis</h2>
<p>
  The Nazi regime introduced wide-ranging <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Nazi policies aimed to reduce unemployment through construction projects and military build-up.">economic changes</span>. Programmes like <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Autobahn construction, housing projects, and infrastructure expansion were used to create jobs.">public works</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Massive expansion of the army and weapons industry reduced unemployment and prepared Germany for war.">rearmament</span> reduced unemployment. The regime also promoted <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Germany sought to rely only on domestic resources through plans like the Four-Year Plan.">self-sufficiency</span>. During the war, the economy shifted to a war footing, with severe consequences for civilians including <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Bombing raids from 1942 destroyed cities and infrastructure.">bombing</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Food and goods were strictly rationed to prioritise the military.">rationing</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Millions of men were drafted into the army, leaving labour shortages in factories.">labour shortages</span> and the arrival of <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Displaced persons from occupied countries and areas affected by bombing or advancing armies.">refugees</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Social policy focused on enforcing traditional roles. Women were encouraged to focus on the family and childbearing. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Nazi ideal promoted motherhood over employment, especially after 1933.">Women</span> were removed from many jobs and given awards for having many children. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Organisations like the Hitler Youth and League of German Girls trained youth to be loyal to the regime.">Youth groups</span> became compulsory. Education was changed to promote Nazi ideology and loyalty to Hitler.
</p>
<p>
  Religion was also controlled. The Nazis tried to coordinate Protestant churches under the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A pro-Nazi group of Protestant churches aligned with the regime's values.">Reich Church</span> and suppressed dissent. Catholic churches retained some independence but were monitored closely.
</p>
<p>
  Racial policies were central to Nazi ideology. The Nazis promoted <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The belief that Germans were part of a superior 'Aryan' race.">Aryan ideas</span> and enacted harsh <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Jews, Roma, disabled people, and others faced discrimination, violence, and removal from public life.">racial policies</span>. These escalated into the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Nazi plan to murder all Jews in Europe through systematic genocide.">Final Solution</span> during the war, resulting in the mass murder of six million Jews.
</p>
<p>
  The Nazis used extensive control mechanisms. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="He coordinated propaganda campaigns, rallies, radio broadcasts and films to promote Nazi ideas.">Goebbels</span> directed propaganda, while censorship restricted free speech. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Cultural output was strictly controlled to reflect Nazi ideals of obedience and nationalism.">Nazi culture</span> promoted loyalty and unity. The police state was enforced by <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Himmler oversaw all Nazi security forces and was one of the main architects of the Holocaust.">Himmler</span>, the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An elite paramilitary organisation loyal to Hitler, responsible for many war crimes.">SS</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The secret police who used surveillance, informers, and torture to suppress opposition.">Gestapo</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Despite fear and repression, some groups resisted the regime. These included student-led initiatives like the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="University students in Munich who distributed anti-Nazi leaflets; executed in 1943.">White Rose</span>, youth countercultures like the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A group that rejected Nazi youth culture and listened to swing music.">Swing Youth</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Working-class youth who resisted conformity and sometimes engaged in sabotage.">Edelweiss Pirates</span>, and military resistance such as the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944, led by Claus von Stauffenberg.">July 1944 bomb plot</span>.

<h1 style="color: #2a4b7c; margin-top: 4rem;">Conflict and Tension between East and West <strong class=\"date\">1945–1972</strong></h1>

<h2 id="coldwar-origins">Origins of the Cold War</h2>
<p>
  After the Second World War, tensions grew between the USA and the USSR, shaped by differing <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The USA supported capitalism and democracy, while the USSR promoted communism and one-party rule.">ideologies</span> and ambitions. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Meetings in 1945 where Allied leaders discussed the post-war world. Yalta (Feb) was more cooperative; Potsdam (Jul) exposed tensions.">Yalta and Potsdam Conferences</span> highlighted these divisions. Germany was divided, and Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill, Attlee, and Truman all played major roles. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The USA dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. It worsened Soviet mistrust.">dropping of the atom bomb</span> increased Soviet fears.
</p>
<p>
  As Stalin expanded Soviet control over Eastern Europe, Churchill warned of an <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Churchill’s 1946 speech referred to the ideological divide across Europe, with Soviet control of the East.">Iron Curtain</span>. In response, the USA announced the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Truman’s 1947 policy of containing communism, marking the start of active US involvement in Cold War politics.">Truman Doctrine</span> and launched the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A $13 billion US aid programme for Europe, aiming to rebuild economies and resist communism.">Marshall Plan</span>, which Stalin saw as a threat. He countered with <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Set up in 1947 to coordinate Eastern Bloc communist parties and ensure loyalty to the USSR.">Cominform</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="An economic organisation for Soviet-aligned countries, created in 1949 to rival the Marshall Plan.">Comecon</span>. Even <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A communist state under Tito that resisted full Soviet control, creating tension within the Eastern Bloc.">Yugoslavia</span> pursued a more independent path. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="In 1948–49, Stalin blocked land access to West Berlin. The Allies responded with a massive airlift to supply the city.">Berlin Blockade and Airlift</span> became a major flashpoint.
</p>

<h2 id="coldwar-development">Development of the Cold War</h2>
<p>
  Events in Asia influenced superpower relations. The USSR supported <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Leader of the Chinese Communist Party, who took power in 1949 after civil war.">Mao Zedong</span> in China, and conflict followed in Korea and Vietnam. North Korea invaded the South in 1950, leading to <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A UN-led military effort led by the USA to defend South Korea from communist invasion.">UN military involvement</span>, while the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Vietnamese communist fighters who fought against French and later US-supported forces.">Vietcong</span> resisted Western-backed control in Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
  Military rivalry escalated through the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Both superpowers developed large stockpiles of nuclear weapons, including H-bombs and ICBMs.">arms race</span>. The USA formed <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Established in 1949, a Western military alliance to resist Soviet aggression.">NATO</span>, and the USSR responded with the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A Soviet-led military alliance formed in 1955 as a counter to NATO.">Warsaw Pact</span>. The <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The USA and USSR competed in space exploration to demonstrate technological superiority.">space race</span> saw milestones like <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Launched in 1957, it was the first artificial satellite, triggering the US to invest heavily in space technology.">Sputnik</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads across continents.">ICBMs</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A US submarine-launched nuclear missile system.">Polaris</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The first human in space, launched by the USSR in 1961.">Gagarin</span>, and the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The US moon landing mission in 1969, seen as a major Cold War victory.">Apollo</span> programme.
</p>
<p>
  The ‘Thaw’ referred to a temporary easing of tensions. In Hungary, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Hungarian Prime Minister in 1956 who introduced reforms and tried to leave the Warsaw Pact.">Nagy</span> led a <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A 1956 uprising demanding political freedoms and Soviet withdrawal, crushed by the Red Army.">reform movement</span>. Soviet suppression had lasting consequences. Later, the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="In 1960, an American spy plane was shot down over the USSR, worsening relations.">U2 Crisis</span> sabotaged the Paris Peace Summit and stalled diplomatic progress.

<h2 id="coldwar-transformation">Transformation of the Cold War</h2>
<p>
  In <strong class="date">1961</strong>, the Soviets built the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A physical barrier built to stop East Germans fleeing to the West, symbolising Cold War division.">Berlin Wall</span>. President <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="US President 1961–63, known for his firm stance during the Berlin and Cuban crises.">Kennedy</span> responded with public shows of resolve.
</p>
<p>
  Cuba became a hotspot after <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Overthrew the pro-US Batista regime in 1959 and aligned with the USSR.">Castro's revolution</span>. The failed <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="1961 invasion attempt by US-backed Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro.">Bay of Pigs</span> invasion embarrassed the USA. Tensions peaked during the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="October 1962 crisis over Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, nearly causing nuclear war.">missile crisis</span>, involving <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Leader of the USSR during the Cuban Missile Crisis.">Khrushchev</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="US President during the Cuban Missile Crisis, who negotiated a peaceful resolution.">Kennedy</span>. The crisis revealed the danger of escalation and led to increased communication.

The USSR responded harshly, reaffirming control through the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Soviet policy justifying intervention in other socialist countries to maintain communism.">Brezhnev Doctrine</span>, straining East-West relations.
</p>
<p>
  Despite ongoing issues like <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Western criticism of the USSR's harsh censorship, political imprisonment, and lack of freedom.">human rights abuses</span>, the late 1960s saw efforts at <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The easing of Cold War tensions, marked by cooperation and arms control agreements.">détente</span>. <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Strategic Arms Limitation Talks – SALT 1 was signed in 1972 to curb nuclear weapons development.">SALT 1</span> was signed, and leaders like <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, 1964–1982.">Brezhnev</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="US President 1969–1974 who pursued détente and arms control with the USSR.">Nixon</span> promoted dialogue.
