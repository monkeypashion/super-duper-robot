    <h3 id="natural-hazards">Section A – The Challenge of Natural Hazards</h3>

    <h2>Natural Hazards</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A natural event that threatens people or property.">Natural hazards</span> 
      are extreme natural events that pose significant risk to people and property. The main types are 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Caused by physical processes like earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis.">tectonic</span>, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Includes hurricanes, floods, and heatwaves.">weather</span>, 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Global long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.">climate-related</span> 
      hazards. Risk is influenced by factors such as population density, level of preparedness, and economic development.
    </p>

    <h2>Tectonic Hazards</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Physical Processes:</strong> 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Explains the movement of Earth's plates and their interactions at boundaries.">Plate tectonics theory</span> 
      explains how earthquakes and volcanoes occur at different types of 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Constructive, destructive and conservative plate margins.">plate margins</span>. 
      These movements release energy or magma, causing hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Effects & Responses:</strong> 
      The 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Direct impacts such as building collapse.">primary effects</span> 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Follow-on impacts like disease or loss of income.">secondary effects</span> 
      of tectonic hazards vary between 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="High-income vs low-income countries.">contrasting levels of wealth</span>. 
      Immediate responses may include rescue efforts, while long-term responses involve rebuilding and planning. 
      Case studies show how wealth impacts the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Management:</strong> 
      Despite the risk, people continue living in hazardous zones due to factors like family ties or economic benefits. 
      Risk reduction involves 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Using instruments to detect seismic activity.">monitoring</span>, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Educated guesses about future events.">prediction</span>, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Barriers or building design to withstand damage.">protection</span> 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Evacuation plans and public awareness.">planning</span>.
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Chile & Nepal -->
    <p><strong>Example: 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Chile (2010) and Nepal (2015) earthquakes illustrate how wealth influences immediate and long-term responses. Chile’s strong infrastructure led to quicker recovery; Nepal’s limited resources meant more severe impacts and slower rebuilding.">
        Chile & Nepal
      </span>
    </strong></p>

    <h2>Weather Hazards</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Global Circulation:</strong> 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Global pattern of air movement, influencing pressure belts and winds.">Atmospheric circulation</span> 
      helps explain global climate patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tropical Storms:</strong> 
      These storms form in specific conditions and include 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Also called hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons depending on region.">cyclones</span> 
      and hurricanes. Their structure, development, and impact are shaped by temperature and wind conditions. 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Increased warming may lead to more intense storms.">Climate change</span> 
      could affect their frequency and strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Impacts & Management:</strong> 
      Tropical storms can devastate communities and ecosystems. Effects vary widely and are shown through named examples. 
      Risk is reduced through prediction, protection and preparation.
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Typhoon Haiyan -->
    <p><strong>Example: 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Typhoon Haiyan (2013) in the Philippines was a powerful category 5 storm causing devastating storm surges, flooding, and high winds. International aid and effective planning were crucial in the response.">

      </span>
    </strong></p>

    <p>
      <strong>UK Weather Hazards:</strong> 
      The UK experiences multiple weather hazards. 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Storms, floods, heatwaves, snow and droughts.">Extreme events</span> 
      are increasingly common and affect infrastructure, economy and health. 
      Case studies show causes, impacts and management of recent extreme events.
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Somerset Levels -->
    <p><strong>Example: 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Somerset Levels floods in 2013–14 were triggered by prolonged rain and high tides. Homes and farmland were flooded, leading to dredging and improved defences.">
        Somerset Levels
      </span>
    </strong></p>

    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Causes & Effects:</strong> 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Long-term change in Earth’s average temperature and weather patterns.">Climate change</span> 
      is driven by 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Volcanic eruptions, solar output, Earth’s orbit.">natural factors</span> 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Fossil fuel use, deforestation, agriculture.">human activities</span>. 
      Evidence includes ice cores and temperature records. Effects are wide-ranging for people and ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Managing Climate Change:</strong> 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Reducing causes of climate change.">Mitigation</span> 
      strategies include renewable energy, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Capturing and storing carbon emissions underground.">carbon capture</span>, 
      tree planting, and international agreements. 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Adjusting to the impacts of climate change.">Adaptation</span> 
      includes improving water supply, building flood defences and altering farming practices.
    </p>

    <h3 id="living-world">Section B – The Living World</h3>

    <h2 id="ecosystems">Ecosystems</h2>
    <p>
      Ecosystems are communities where 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Living components like animals and plants.">biotic</span> 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Non-living components like climate and soil.">abiotic</span> 
      components interact. Small scale UK examples show how components like producers, consumers and decomposers form food chains 
      and nutrient cycles. Changes to one part can affect the whole system. Also studied are the global distribution and features of 
      large-scale ecosystems (<span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Large-scale ecosystems like rainforests or deserts.">biomes</span>).
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Epping Forest -->
    <p><strong>Example:
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Epping Forest is a small-scale UK ecosystem. It highlights interdependence: if one element (e.g. vegetation) changes, knock-on effects occur through the food web.">
        Epping Forest
      </span>
    </strong></p>

    <h2 id="rainforests">Tropical Rainforests</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics:</strong> 
      Rainforests have distinct features shaped by 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Climate, soil, water, animals and plants working together.">interdependence</span> 
      of climate, soil, vegetation, and fauna. High biodiversity and plant adaptation are key traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Deforestation:</strong> 
      Driven by logging, farming, mining, settlement and energy demands. Impacts include 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Erosion, climate change, biodiversity loss.">environmental damage</span> 
      and economic trade-offs. Case studies show changing rates and impacts of deforestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Management:</strong> 
      Sustainable management involves selective logging, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Replanting trees after harvesting.">replanting</span>, 
      education, ecotourism, and debt-for-nature agreements to conserve forest ecosystems.
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Amazon -->
    <p><strong>Example:
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Amazon rainforest faces large-scale deforestation for cattle ranching, logging, and agriculture. This causes significant biodiversity loss, carbon emissions, and conflict with local communities.">
        Amazon
      </span>

        Amazon
      </a>
    </strong></p>

    <h2 id="hot-deserts">Hot Deserts</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Characteristics:</strong> 
      Hot deserts also have distinct climates and ecosystems. Plants and animals adapt to survive in dry, hot conditions. 
      Biodiversity is lower than in rainforests but equally interconnected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Opportunities & Challenges:</strong> 
      Development includes mining, tourism and farming. Challenges include 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Dry climate, poor water access, and extreme temperatures.">extreme environments</span> 
      and accessibility. Case studies show how people adapt and develop in desert regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Desertification:</strong> 
      Areas around deserts face the threat of 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Spread of desert conditions into semi-arid areas.">desertification</span>, 
      caused by overgrazing, deforestation and climate change. Management includes water conservation, tree planting and better land use.
    </p>

    <!-- Example: Western Desert -->
    <p><strong>Example:
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The Western Desert (USA) region offers opportunities such as solar power, farming via irrigation, and tourism. However, harsh climate and water scarcity pose major challenges.">
        Western Desert

    <h2>Resource Management in the UK</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>UK Challenges:</strong> 
      Changing demand and provision of resources such as 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="E.g. growing demand for seasonal food, organic produce, and high-value exports.">food</span>, 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="E.g. water transfer schemes, pollution management, supply and demand balance.">water</span>, 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="E.g. reliance on fossil fuels vs renewable sources.">energy</span> 
      create both opportunities and challenges.
    </p>

    <h2>Energy</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Global Demand:</strong> 
      There is a rising 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Differences in energy production and use between regions.">demand</span> 
      for energy but supply may be 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="When demand exceeds secure supply.">insecure</span>, 
      leading to potential conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strategies:</strong> 
      Ways to increase supply include 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, biomass, etc.">renewables</span> 
      and 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Oil, coal, gas, nuclear.">non-renewables</span>. 
      Examples show how energy use and conservation help build a 
      <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Future where energy needs are met without harming the environment.">sustainable resource future</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Case studies illustrate local and global schemes to increase energy security.
